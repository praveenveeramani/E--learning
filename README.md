This project involved developing a machine learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect and classify major rice leaf diseases such as leaf blast, bacterial blight, and brown spot. The system utilizes image processing techniques to analyze leaf images and accurately identify the disease type, enabling timely intervention for farmers to manage and mitigate crop losses effectively. The project was conducted in collaboration with classmates Dharshana S, Vanitha V, and Vijayananth S at University College of Engineering, Panruti.
